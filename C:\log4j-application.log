Korolev, whose importance had remained undisclosed by the Soviet press during his lifetime, died during surgery for removal of a tumor in his colon.[78] In an editorial a week later, the New York Times eulogized him by noting that "[D]eath has finally declassified the role and identity of Academician Sergei P. Korolev, the man who provided the scientific and technical leadership of the Soviet rocket program... Korolev's rockets were powerful enough to send men into orbit and to put cameras in into position to photograph the back side of the Moon. But they were too weak to break the chains of secrecy that denied him, while he lived, the world applause he deserved...." [79]
